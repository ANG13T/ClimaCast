## About
ClimaCast is a command-line tool written with Python that provides meteorology reports and forecasts, satellite pass predictions, communications decoding, and imagery analysis for NOAA satellites.

## Preview

## Features
ClimaCast features four main features for NOAA satellite reconnaissance. They include the following:

### ðŸŒ¦  Weather Forecasts and Alerts
You can visualize and extract information from DJI file formats such as CSV, KML, and GPX using the parsing tool.
The parsed information can be saved into an alternative file format when inputted an output file path.
The image below includes an example of a parsed file output and the type of data extracted from the file.

###  ðŸ›°  Pass Predictor
Steganography refers to the process of revealing information stored within files.
The DroneXtract steganography suite allows you to extract telemetry and valuable data from image and video formats.
Additionally, the extracted data can be exported to four different file formats.

### ðŸ“¡  APT Image Decoder
The telemetry visualization suite contains a flight path mapping generator and a telemetry graph visualizer.
The flight path mapping generator creates an image of a map indicating the locations the drone traveled to enroute and the path it took.
The telemetry graph visualizer plots a graph for each of the relevant telemetry or sensor values to be used for auditing purposes.

### ðŸŒŽ  Meteorological Image Analysis
The flight and integrity analysis tool iterates through all the telemetry values the drone logged during its flight.
Once the values are collected, it calculates the maximum variance assumed by the value and checks for suspicious data gaps.
This tool can be used to check for anomalous data or any file corruption that may have taken place.

## Usage
To run ClimaCast, you will need Python3 and Pip installed.

```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ python3 climacast.py
```

## Configuration
There are a set of environment variables utilized in DroneXtract. In order to tailor the values to your specific drone / investigation scenario, you can go to the `.env` file and adjust the following values:

`TELEMETRY_VIS_DOWNSAMPLE` downsampling number for values to be used for telemetry visualization

`FLIGHT_MAP_DOWNSAMPLE` downsampling number for values to be used for flight path mapping

`ANALYSIS_DOWNSAMPLE` downsampling number for values to be used for integrity analysis

`ANALYSIS_MAX_VARIANCE` maximum variance allowed between max and min value for analysis values
